Room completed: Phishing Emails in Action (TryHackMe)

Key phishing indicators learned:
- Sender domain was newly registered (5 days old) and suspicious
- Email impersonated HR with an urgent subject line
- Embedded link URL did not match the displayed text

Would escalate?
No. The user did not click the link. Actions taken included quarantining the email, blocking the sender domain, user awareness, and monitoring for similar phishing attempts.
